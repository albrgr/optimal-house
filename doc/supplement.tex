\section{Stromberg Model}
This section describes a version of Stromberg's model suitable for analyzing U.S. House elections. The model is essentially the same as the one used in \citet{stromberg2008electoral} to analyze presidential elections except for two minor changes that account for differences in the electoral settings. First, all districts are worth one seat while states in presidential elections are weighted according to their electoral votes. Second, parties maximize both the probability of winning a majority of seats (which is the equivalent of winning a majority of electoral college votes in presidential elections) and the expected number of seats. The second maximization problem is not considered in \citet{stromberg2008electoral} because presidential candidates are concerned with winning the election, not maximizing their electoral votes.

\subsection{Set Up}
The model considers electoral competition between two parties, labeled Republican $R$ and Democrat $D$.\footnote{Third party candidates are ignored.} During the campaign, each party must decide how to optimally allocate funds across the 435 Congressional districts. More formally, party $J = D, R$ must choose expenditures in district $i$, $e^J_i$, subject to the resource constraint, 
\begin{align} \label{eqn: budget constraint}
\sum_{i=1}^{435} e^J_i \leq E^J,
\end{align}
where $E^J$ is the amount of money party $J$ has to spend on candidates.

The share of votes received by party $D$ in district $i$ is assumed to depend on four primary factors: spending by the national parties, predetermined characteristics of the district, the national political climate, and unknown shocks. The effect of the choice variable, $e^J_i$, is assumed to be an increasing concave function, $u(e^J_i)$, so that the effect of spending decreases with the amount of spending. The predetermined district characteristics and the national climate are known before the spending decision is made and can be used to make a prediction, $V_i$, of party $D$'s vote share. Finally, there are two sources of uncertainty, a national error, $\delta$, and a district specific error, $\epsilon_i$. The national errors represent uncertain national swings that affect all districts equally and the district errors are unpredictable swings unique to each district. Both error terms are independently drawn from normal distributions,
\begin{align}
h(\delta) = N(\delta|0, \sigma^2_\delta)
\end{align}
and 
\begin{align}
g_i(\epsilon_i) = N(\epsilon_i|0, \sigma^2).
\end{align}
Letting $u(e^D_i) - u(e^R_i) = \Delta u_i$, party $R$ will consequently win a district if,
\begin{align} \label{eqn: Republican wins}
\Delta u_i + V_i + \delta + \epsilon_i \leq 1/2.
\end{align}
The probability of a victory by party $R$ conditional on expenditures, $e^D_i$ and $e^R_i$, and the national swing, $\delta$, is therefore,
\begin{align*}
G_i(1/2 - \Delta u_i - V_i - \delta),
\end{align*}
where $G_i(\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of $\epsilon_i$. It follows that if $s_i$ is an indicator variable equal to 1 if party $R$ wins a district and $0$ if party $D$ wins, then $s_i = 1$ with probability $G_i(\cdot)$ and $s_i = 0$ with probability $1 - G_i(\cdot)$. The total number of Republican seats is $S = \sum_{i=1}^{435} s_i$. Furthermore, since the $G_i(\cdot)$ are independently (but not identically) distributed conditional on $\delta$, $S$ follows a Poisson binomial distribution with mean
\begin{align} \label{eqn: conditional seat mean}
\mu_S = \mu_S(\Delta u, \delta) =  \sum_{i=1}^{435} G_i(\cdot),
\end{align}
and variance,
\begin{align} \label{eqn: conditional seat variance}
\sigma_S = \sigma_S(\Delta u, \delta) = \sum_{i=1}^{435} G_i(\cdot)(1 - G_i(\cdot)),
\end{align}
where $\Delta \mu = \left(\Delta \mu_1, \Delta \mu_2, \ldots, \Delta \mu_{435} \right)$ represents the utility differences resulting from any allocation of campaign resources across districts by the two parties.

\subsection{Party Goals}
Optimal strategies depend on the objective of the national parties. Unlike in presidential campaigns where the goal is clearly to win the election, the goals of the parties in House campaigns are less straightforward. As a result, I consider two plausible objective functions. 

The first objective function assumes that parties simply maximize the expected number of House seats. For party $R$, this is just the expectation of $\mu_S$ over the national shocks,
\begin{align} \label{eqn: expected number of seats}
\E\left[S (\Delta \mu)\right] = \int \sum_{i=1}^{435} G_i(1/2 - \Delta u_i - V_i - \delta)h(\delta) d\delta.
\end{align}

A second possibility is that parties maximize the probability of winning a majority of seats. For party $R$ this is,
\begin{align}
P^R(\Delta \mu) = \int \rm{Pr}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{435} s_i > 218 \right) h(\delta)d \delta.
\end{align}

This function is more difficult to maximize than equation~\ref{eqn: expected number of seats} because it is not additively separable across districts; that is, party $R$'s optimal strategy in one district depends on its strategy in all other districts. In order to solve the problem analytically, \citet{stromberg2008electoral} suggests calculating the approximate probability of winning instead. Since the national and district shocks are independent, this can be done by using the Lyapunov Central Limit Theorem, which does not require random variables to be identically distributed. Using this approximation, the number of seats won by party $R$, $S=\sum_{i=1}^{435} s_i$, is asymptotically normally distributed with mean $\mu_S$ and variance $\sigma_S$. The approximate probability of party $R$ winning the election is then,
\begin{align}
P^R(\Delta \mu) = \int 1 - \Phi\left(\frac{218 - \mu_S(\Delta u, \delta)}{\sigma_S(\Delta u, \delta)}\right) h(\delta)d\delta,
\end{align}
where $\Phi(\cdot)$ is the standard normal cumulative density function.

\subsection{Equilibrium} \label{sec: equilibrium}
Let $e^j = (e_1^j, e_2^j, \ldots, e_{435}^j)$ be the allocation of campaign spending across districts by party $j$ and $f^R(e^D, e^R)$ be the objective function used by party $R$. A Nash equilibrium in pure strategies $(e^{D*}, e^{R*})$ is then characterized by,
\begin{align}
f^R(e^D, e^{R*}) \geq f^R(e^{D*}, e^{R*}) \geq f^R(e^{D*}, e^{R}),
\end{align}
where $e^D$ and $e^R$ satisfy the budget constraint in equation~\ref{eqn: budget constraint}. The game has a unique interior NE which satisfies,
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial f^J}{\partial e_i^J}= Q_i u'(e^{J*}_i)=\lambda^J,
\end{align}
where $Q_i = \partial f^J/ \partial \Delta u_i$ and $\lambda^J$ is the Lagrange multiplier for party $j$.\footnote{For a proof of uniqueness see \citet{stromberg2008electoral}.} Since $u'(e^J)$ is decreasing in $e^J$, the parties allocate more resources to districts with higher values of $Q_i$. The value of $Q_i$ will of course depend on the choice of the objective function.

When parties maximize the expected number of seats, $Q_i$ is easy to calculate and is just, 
\begin{align} \label{eqn: Q_i expected seats}
Q_i = Q_i^{seats} = \int  g_i(1/2 - \Delta u_i - V_i - \delta) h(\delta) d\delta.
\end{align}
Not unexpectedly, districts with a predicted vote share close to 1/2 should receive the most expenditures. Spending should also be more concentrated when the error terms, $\sigma$ and $\delta$, are smaller. If on the other hand, parties maximize the probability of winning a majority of seats, $Q_i$ is more intricate. For party $R$, it is,
\begin{align} \label{eqn: Q_i probability of winning}
Q_i  = Q_i^{maj} &= - \int \left(\frac{\partial \Phi(\cdot)}{\partial \mu_S}\frac{\partial \mu_S}{\partial \Delta u_i}+\frac{\partial \Phi(\cdot)}{\partial \sigma_S}\frac{\partial \sigma_S}{\partial \Delta u_i}\right)h(\delta)d\delta  \\
& = \int \frac{1}{\sigma_S}\phi(x(\delta))g_i(\cdot)h(\delta)d\delta \nonumber \\
 &\qquad + \int \frac{1}{\sigma_S}\phi(x(\delta))x(k, \delta)\left(1-2G_i(\cdot)\right) g_i(\cdot)h(\delta)d\delta,
\end{align}
where $x(\delta) = \left(218 - \mu_S\right)/\sigma_S$. The first term is the effect of an increase in spending on the mean number of Republican seats while the second term is its effect on the variance. Parties have an incentive to influence the variance because they want to increase the probability of a desirable outcome. The trailing party will want to increase the variance to increase the probability of a major change in the election outcome while the leading party will want to do just the opposite. The trailing party can increase the variance by spending more on districts in which its candidate it losing and the leading party can decrease the variance by spending more on districts in which it is winning. Intuitively, the leading party does not need to worry about districts in which it is losing because it only needs to make sure that it holds on to the one's it is leading in.

As shown by \citet{stromberg2008electoral}, an alternative interpretation of equation~\ref{eqn: Q_i probability of winning} is that it is the probability that a district is 1) decisive in whether or not a party wins a majority of seats and 2) the district is a swing district. Following Stromberg, I call such a district a ``decisive swing district''. The probability of being a swing district is the probability that an electoral race is tied (or at least very close), while a district is decisive if winning (or losing) that district would make the difference between winning (or losing) a majority of seats. The idea that parties should spend more money on swing districts is consistent with the first order condition in equation~\ref{eqn: Q_i expected seats}. The idea that parties should spend more on decisive (also known as pivotal) districts differentiates the two maximization problems.

\subsection{Functional Form} \label{sec: functional form}
In order to solve for equilibrium spending, $e_i^{J*}$ and calculate $Q_i$, it is necessary to make an assumption about the functional form of $u(e_i^J)$. One functional form particularly amenable to empirical analysis is the logarithmic form, $u(e_i^J)= \theta \log (e_i^J)$, which results in the first order condition for district $k$ and party $J$,
\begin{align} \label{eqn: equilibrium spending}
e_k^{J*} = \frac{Q_k}{\sum Q_i}E^{J}.
\end{align} 
Each party spends the same fraction of the budget on district $k$, but $e_i^{R*}$ only equals $e_i^{D*}$ if both parties have identical budgets so that $E^{R} = E^{D}$.\footnote{For a formal proof that $e_i^{D*} = e_i^{R*}$ in equilibrium when $E^R = E^D$ see \citet{stromberg2008electoral}} Equation~\ref{eqn: equilibrium spending} implies that $Q_i$ is evaluated at $\Delta u_i = \theta \log(E^D/E^R)$, which reduces to $\Delta u_i=0$ when the budgets are equal. If $\theta$, $E^D$ or $E^R$ are unknown (and time-varying), then this term will be incorporated into the national shock, $\delta$, during estimation.

\section{Data}
The analyses in this paper requires data for three separate analyses. First, foreceasting variables are needed for the Bayesian hierarchical model. Second, both district and national polls are used for the Bayesian DLM. Third, campaign data is used to examine whether political parties donate in a manner consistent with the model.

\subsection{Forecasting Variables}
The regression forecast includes variables (and error terms) at the national and district level.\footnote{Regional variables were also considered but they did not improve the fit of the model and only increased model complexity.} Forecasts are made as of August of each election year using post 1980 data so all variables are measured before September 1st.

The primary dependent variable is the Democratic share of the two-party vote. This is not the only possible choice for the response variable but it is frequently used in the literature. Other choice that are essentially identical include the incumbent party's share of the vote or the margin of victory for the incumbent candidate.

House elections are highly persistent from one election to the next so they can be predicted quite accurately using only the lag of the two-party vote. The lag is of course unavailable without substantial reaggregation in redistricting years so, as is common in the literature, the analysis excludes years ending in 2.\footnote{Examples of other studies that deal with redistricting years in this manner include \citet{gelman1990estimating}, \citet{kastellec2008predicting}, and \citet{gelman2008estimating}.} The lagged vote is tied in many respects to individual candidates and is not surprisingly a much stronger predictor of the vote when incumbents are running for re-election than in open-seats \citep{gelman2008estimating}. The model consequently includes the lag of the presidential vote in each district in addition to the lag of the House vote. The presidential vote is subtracted from the nationwide presidential vote to control for national trends and can be interpreted as a measure of the degree to which a district leans toward one party or another.\footnote{This variable is very similar to the Cook Partisan Voting Index (Cook PVI), which compares the two-party vote in the past two presidential elections to the nation's average share of the same presidential vote. The main difference is that I only include the previous presidential election becase of redistricting.}\footnote{Models that interacted both the lagged vote and the centered presidential vote with whether incumbents were running were also considered, but did not lead to improvements in the fit of the model.}

One of the largest and most consistent findings in the political science literature on American elections is that, all else equal, incumbent candidates receive more votes than challengers \citep{{gelman1990estimating, lee2001electoral, ansolabehere2002incumbency, gelman2008estimating}}. To model this incumbency effect, I use the variable, \emph{Incumbent}, which is equal to $1$ if the incumbent is a Democrat, $-1$ if the incumbent is a Republican and $0$ if there is no incumbent running. $+1, 0, -1$ variables are used repeatedly in the analysis and are always equal to +1 for Democrats and -1 for Republicans; they should be thought of as dummy variables that are constrained to have the same impact on the vote for both Democratic and Republican candidates (recall that the dependent variable is the Democratic candidate's share of the two-party vote).

Since more experienced candidates tend to do better at the polls, I include two $+1, 0, -1$ experience variables: \emph{Freshman incumbent} and \emph{Previous office holder}. \emph{Freshman incumbent} is equal to +1(-1) if a Democratic (Republican) incumbent was elected for the first time in the previous election and 0 otherwise. \emph{Previous office holder} is equal to +1 or -1 if a Democrat or Republican challenger had previously held office and was running against either an incumbent or a challenger without previous experience; it is equal to 0 in all other situations including open seats in which both candidates had previous political experience.

The model also accounts for the ideology of candidates relative to the ideology of voters in their districts. Candidate ideology is measured using the first dimension DW-nominate score---which measures the political ideology of candidates and ranges on a liberal-conservative scale from -1 to 1. A measure of district ideology on the same scale as the DW-nominate score was created by taking a weighted average of the DW-nominate scores of the most recent presidential candidates for each party, with weights equal to each party's share of the district two-party vote in the most recent presidential election.\footnote{Michael Dukakis does not have a DW-nominate score so his ideology was imputed using the mean score among Democratic presidential candidates between 1980 and 2010.} The variable used in the model, \emph{Relative 1st dimension DW-nominate score}, is the DW-nominate score minus the district ideology score.\footnote{This variable outperformed another variable which interacted the absolute value of the DW-nominate with the party controlling the seat, suggesting that voting moderation is more strongly associated with higher vote shares than a candidate's ideological distance from the ideology of his or her voters.} In incumbent districts, this variable will have a positive sign if candidates do better at the polls when they have more moderate voting records (perhaps because they appeal more to independent voters), conditional on winning the primary election. In open seats, this variable will be positive if voters tend to elect a Democratic candidate when the previous candidate(s) had a conservative voting record and a Republican candidate when the previous candidate(s) had a liberal voting record.\footnote{In open districts, the DW-nominate score is equal to the average DW-nominate score among all representatives in the previous Congress. Most districts only have one representative per congressional session but certain events such as deaths create scenarios in which this is not the case.}\footnote{In OLS regressions, the coefficient on the interaction of the relative DW-nominate score variable with whether a seat is open is essentially zero, implying that the effect of the variable does not differ by whether a seat is open or not.}

The model also includes three nationwide variables: the president's average August approval rating, the August generic ballot and an indicator variable for whether the election is being held in a midterm year.\footnote{A variable including second quarter GDP was also considered but it was not statistically or economically significant.} The \emph{August generic ballot} variable is an average of generic ballot polls in the month of August in each election year. Both the midterm variable and the presidential approval variable are multiplied by +1 if the president is a Democrat and -1 if Republican. The impetus for the \emph{midterm election} variable is previous research showing that the party of the president usually loses seats during midterm election \citep[e.g.][]{erikson1988puzzle}. 

Summary statistics for these variables are presented in~\autoref{table:Summary Statistics for Forecasting Variables}. Variables rarely exceed one in absolute value and are thus on a similar scale to the dependent variable.



\subsection{Campaign Spending} \label{sec: campaign spending}
House candidates receive funds from three primary sources: party committees, PACs, and individuals.\footnote{Organizations---such as firms, unions or trade associations---that wish to spend money to influence federal elections must create a separate source of funds known as a PAC.} Campaign donors can, in turn, spend on the behalf of candidates by either making a direct contribution, a coordinated expenditure or an indirect expenditure for or against a candidate.\footnote{A common example of an independent expenditure is a TV advertisement praising a candidate or criticizing an opponent. Before 2010, corporations and unions could only fund independent expenditures from their PACs; however in 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court rule in \emph{Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission} that corporations and unions could use their own treasuries to raise money for independent expenditures.} Independent expenditures are not limited by law but cannot be coordinated with campaigns. By contrast, direct contributions and coordinated expenditures can be coordinated with a campaign but are limited by federal law.\footnote{Coordinate expenditures, are, as the name suggests, expenditures made on the behalf of campaigns that can be discussed with the campaign.}

Although campaign fund-raising is a year-round endeavor for political candidates, it follows a cyclical pattern and naturally heats up as election day nears. This is shown in~\autoref{fig:Average Daily Expenditures by PACs on Candidates by Month, 2000 - 2010}, which plots average daily spending by PACs in election years by month across the 2000 - 2010 elections. Expenditures are fairly constant from January until August and then jump considerably in September before peaking at around \$4 million dollars per day in October and then decreasing slightly in November.\footnote{November expenditures only include spending that occurred prior to election day. Between 2000 - 2010, the latest election occurred on November 7th.} 

Political parties are the focus of this paper, so it is worth examining the spending patterns of party committees in detail. The official campaign arms of the Democratic and Republican party in the House are the Democratic Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC). The principal goal of these organizations is to assist House candidates and help elect them to Congress. Direct contributions and coordinated expenditure are severely limited by contributions limits, so almost all spending is made independently of candidates. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Republican National Committee (RNC) sometimes spend money on House candidates as well, but the amount is trivial compared to the amount spent by the DCCC and NRCC.

While the national party committees have clear incentives to maximize the electoral success of their respective parties, it is unclear whether other organizations share this same goal. \citet{herrnson2009roles} has argued that the reach of political parties extends considerably further than with the national party committees. He views parties as multilayered coalitions that include actors not usually considered as components of the party. I adopt this classification scheme and separate parties into three separate categories: national party committees, party-connected committees, and allied PACs. 

The national party committees are the DCCC, NRCC, DNC and RNC. Party-connected committees consist of state and local party committees, candidate committees, and House candidate's leadership PACs. These committees have incentives to adopt spending strategies based on private or local goals, but \citet{herrnson2009roles} argues that they attempt to advance their party's collective goals as well. Spending by state and local party committees is also tied to the desires of the national parties because a significant portion of their receipts come from transfers from the DNC and RNC.\footnote{The state and local party committees receive most of their funds from individual contributions and transfers from affiliated party committees.} Finally, following \citet{herrnson2009roles}, I consider allied PACs to be PACs that spend over $90\%$ of their funds on one party's candidates.

Post-August spending for these groups and other non-aligned PACs are shown in~\autoref{table:Average Post-August Spending by Political Parties per District in Non-Redistricting Years, 2000 - 2010}. The table reports spending per district averaged over all non-redistricting year elections from 2000 - 2010. The national party committees spend considerably more than all other groups as national party committee spending is between 45 and 50 percent of all PAC and party spending for both the Democratic and Republican parties. Allied PACs and other non-aligned PACs are the next largest spenders. PACs are considerably more likely to be allied with Democrats than Republicans, although spending by non-aligned PACs is similar for both Republican and Democratic candidates. Spending by party-connected committees makes up less than $10\%$ of total PAC and party committee spending, making them the least prolific spending group. In total, slightly more is spent on Democrats than Republicans.

Candidates also receive a large percentage of their funds from individuals. Contributions from individuals donating over \$200 are itemized but contributions from smaller donors are not. During the 2009 - 2010 election cycle, only $0.26\%$ of the U.S. population gave more than \$200, but total contributions for these individuals summed to \$1.9 billion while contributions from all other individuals were only \$1.1 billion.\footnote{See \url{https://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/}.} Individuals who donated over \$200 spent \$$\expindivsdem$ and \$$\expindivsrep$ per district on Democratic and Republican candidates after August 31st in non-redistricting years from 2000 - 2010 respectively. Since contributions for individuals who donated less than \$200 are not itemized, I cannot make a comparable calculation for donations from these individuals. However, if one assumes that spending on House candidates mirrors total spending, then contributions from small donors should have totaled around \$58,000.\footnote{Individuals donating less than \$200 spent $\$1.1\; \rm{billion}/\$1.9\; \rm{billion} \approx 0.58$ as much as larger donors in 2010. These larger donors, in turn, spend around \$100,000 per district so smaller donors likely spent close to $0.58 \cdot \$100,000 \approx \$58,000$.} Total PAC and party committee spending on House candidates is therefore larger than spending from individuals and the national party committees are the largest single source of funds for House candidates.

\subsection{Polling Data}
A steady stream of polls asking about the generic congressional vote during the 2010 election were released starting as early as December of 2008. All told, the website \href{http://www.realclearpolitics.com/}{Real Clear Politics} gathered  $\gbcount$ polls published by $\countgbpollsters$ different polling organizations over $\gbdays$ days with the last poll conducted $\final_gbday$ days prior to the November 2nd election.\footnote{Polls are typically conducted over multiple days. I consider the poll date to be the midpoint between the start and end date of polling (when the poll is conducted over an even number of days I use the median day closest to the start day).} Most pollsters only published a few polls (median $= \gbpollstermedian$), but the two most prolific pollsters,  Rasmussen and Gallup, conducted $\gbpollsterstop\%$ of all polls. The median sample size across surveys was $\gbmedian_samplesize$ and the average percentage of undecided respondents was $\gbundecided\%$.

District polls were considerably less prolific. Polls were published by $\countpollsters$ different pollsters for $\pollcdcount$ out of the 435 Congressional districts and the median number of polls per district in districts with at least 1 poll was $\pollmedianpercd$. The median sample size for these polls was $\pollmediansamplesize$. 

\autoref{fig:Summary Plots for District Polls} provides summaries of the frequencies at which district polls were fielded. As shown in panel (a) of the figure, polls were considerably more prevalent in close races (those in which the final vote share was close to $0.5$), although few to no polls were published in some close races. This is important for forecasting the election because it means that the districts that are the most difficult to predict are the ones that have the most polling data. This matters for optimal spending as well since it reduces uncertainty about the closeness of a race and provides parties a better sense of which districts to target when attempting to influence the variance of the election.\footnote{Recall that the trailing (leading) party in total seats has an incentive to spend more on districts in which it is losing (winning) if parties are trying to win a majority of seats.}

Panel (b) of the figure shows the cumulative number of polls during each day of the campaign. Nearly 2/3 of the polls were fielded after the start of September, when the rate of polling began accelerating quickly. This temporal pattern is consistent with the monthly pattern in contributions, suggesting that the final two months of campaigns capture the most crucial moments.

\emph{Second quarter GDP}: The percent change in U.S. GDP from one quarter to the next in chained 2009 dollars was considered but not used in the final hierarchical model. It is available for download from the Bureau of Economic Analysis at \url{http://www.bea.gov/national/index.htm}. \\
\emph{Presidential net approval rating}: Approval ratings were scraped from the president specific webpages with links available at \url{http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/CFIDE/roper/presidential/webroot/presidential_rating.cfm}. \\
\emph{Generic Congressional Ballot:} Gallup polls were searched for and downloaded using the iPOLL Databank at(\url{http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/data_access/ipoll/ipoll.html}. There were two main survey questions of interest that were typically worded as ``If the elections for Congress were being held today, which party's candidate would you vote for in your 
Congressional district'' and ``As of today, do you lean more toward''. I consider a respondent to favor a particular party if they say they would vote for that party or they lean more toward that party. Although a sample of likely voters is preferred, Gallup does not include the data used to estimate a likely voter sample, so I use a registered voter sample instead.

\subsubsection{Spending Data}
Data on campaign spending are from the campaign finance data provided by the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) (\url{https://www.opensecrets.org/}). CRP obtains the campaign finance data from the Federal Election Commission and adds value to it by cleaning and categorizing the data. Spending to specific candidates is from the ``PAC'' table and the ``indivs'' table which contain itemized spending data for PACs and individuals contributing over \$200 respectively. Information on the districts of specific candidates is linked to these tables with the ``Cands'' table, which provides information on each candidate. 

\subsubsection{House Polls}
Polls were scraped from the website \url{http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/2010_generic_congressional_vote-2171.html} and the 2010 New York times House election forecasts (\url{http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/forecasts/house}.

\section{Results from the Bayesian Hierarchical Model}
Posterior means and quantiles for the parameters using data from 1980 - 2008 (which was used to forecast the 2010 election) are shown in~\autoref{table:Posterior Inferences for Parameters in Forecasting Model, House Elections 1980 - 2008}. All of the variables (except the August generic ballot) are precisely estimated and have 95\% credibility intervals that do not include zero. The posterior densities for all parameters are all approximately normally distributed,  which is consistent with the central limit theorem in a Bayesian context (see~\autoref{fig:Posterior Densities for Parameters in Forecasting Model} in~\aref{sec: Additional Figures 1}).\footnote{The distribution on the national error is somewhat of an exception because it is somewhat right-skewed. This likely occurs because the number of national elections is small and the the error terms are truncated at zero.}

The signs of the variables are generally as expected. For example, the president's party does worse in midterm years, challengers with previous political experience receive more votes and voters tend to prefer representatives with less extreme DW-nominate scores. The sign on the freshman incumbent variable may be somewhat of a surprise though, as less experienced incumbents are actually predicted to do better than their more experienced counterparts. Finally, the estimated incumbency effect is consistent with previous research, although it is a little closer to typical estimates of the incumbency effect in recent years (of around $10\%$) than the more involved method used by \citet{gelman2008estimating} (which found the incumbency effect to be closer to $8\%$).\footnote{\citet{gelman2008estimating} estimate candidate level incumbency effects using a multilevel model. They also include a model for the party of the incumbent which depends on the district vote lagged two periods.}

Although parameters have only been reported for the model using data from the 1980 to 2008 elections, the model was actually fit 5 separate times in order to imitate 5 separate real-time forecasts using data that would have been available to a political analyst in August \emph{prior} to each election. Each model has its own unique posterior distribution for the parameters. In practice, the district parameters do not vary much from one election to the next but that national parameters (which are estimated using much less data) become more precise over time. 


\section{Gibbs Sampler for the DLM} \label{sec: Gibbs}
\subsection{DLM Form} \label{sec: DLM Form}
\subsubsection{National Model} 
Let $K_t$ be the numbers of polls published on day $t$ and $J$ be the number of polling firms. Then, equations~\ref{observation eqn national} and \ref{system eqn national} can be written in the form,
\begin{align}
\label{eqn: dlm observation}
\underset{(K_t \times 1)}{Y_t} &= \underset{(K_t \times 1)}{F_t} \underset{(1 \times 1)}{\theta_t} + \underset{(K_t \times J)}{A_t} \underset{(J \times 1)}{\Lambda} + \underset{(K_t \times 1)}{v_t},\; v_t \sim N(0, V_t)\\
\label{eqn: dlm state}
\underset{(1 \times 1)}{\theta_t} &= \underset{(1 \times 1)}{G}\underset{(1 \times 1)}{\theta_{t-1}} + \underset{(1 \times 1)}{w_t},\; w_t \sim N(0, W),
\end{align}
where $Y_t$ is a column vector of all polls published at time $t$, $F_t$ is a column vector of $1$'s, $A_t$ is a matrix of binary indicators equal to $1$ if polling firm $j$ published the $k$'th poll and $0$ otherwise, $G=1$, $\theta_t = \mu_t$, $\Lambda =[\lambda_1\; \lambda_2\cdots \lambda_J]^T$,  $V_t$ is a $K_t \times K_t$ diagonal matrix with $\sigma^2_k$ along the diagonal and $W=\sigma^2_\mu$.

\subsubsection{District Model} 
Let $m$ be the number of districts with polling data and $L_t$ be the numbers of polls published on day $t$. Then, equations~\ref{observation eqn district} and \ref{system eqn district} can be written in the form,
\begin{align}
\label{eqn: dlm observation}
\underset{(L_t \times 1)}{Y_t} &= \underset{(L_t \times m)}{F_t} \underset{(m \times 1)}{\theta_t} + \underset{(L_t \times 1)}{v_t},\; v_t \sim N(0, V_t)\\
\label{eqn: dlm state}
\underset{(m \times 1)}{\theta_t} &= \underset{(m \times m)}{G}\underset{(m \times 1)}{\theta_{t-1}} + \underset{(m \times 1)}{w_t},\; w_t \sim N(0, W),
\end{align}
where $Y_t$ is a column vector of all district polls less national opinion at time $t$, $F_t$ is a matrix of binary indicators equal to 1 if poll $l$ is from district $m$, $G= I_m$, $\theta_t = [\xi_{1t}\; \xi_{2t}\cdots \xi_{mt}]^T$, $V_t$ is an $L_t \times L_t$ diagonal matrix with $\sigma^2_l$ along the diagonal and $W = \sigma^2_\xi$.

\subsection{Gibbs Sampler}
\subsubsection{National Model}
Using the DLM form, the joint posterior density of the states and variance parameters is,
\begin{align}
p(\theta_{1:T}, \sigma_\mu^2, \Lambda|Y_{1:T}, A_t, V_{1:T})&=\prod_{t=1}^T p(Y_t|\theta_t, \Lambda, A_t, V_t) \prod_{t=1}^T p(\theta_t|\theta_{t-1}, \sigma_\mu^2) \nonumber\\
&\qquad \times p(\theta_0)p(\sigma_\mu^2)p(\Lambda).
\end{align}
The variance parameter, $\sigma^2_\mu$, is given an inverse gamma prior, $p(\sigma^2_\mu)\sim\rm{IG}(\alpha_\mu, \beta_\mu)$ and the house effects, $\Lambda$, are given independent normal priors, $p(\lambda_j) \sim N(0, \sigma^2_\lambda)$. Using these priors and recalling that $\theta_t = \mu_t$ and $G_t =1$, the Gibbs sampler then proceeds as follows by drawing from the conditional distributions of the unknown parameters.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\sigma_\mu^2$. The conditional distribution is,
\begin{align}
p(\sigma_\mu^2|\ldots)&\propto p(\sigma_\mu^2) \prod_{t=1}^T p(\theta_{t}|\theta_{t-1}, \sigma_\mu^2) \\
&\propto (\sigma_\mu^2)^{(\alpha_\mu - 1)}\exp\left[\frac{\beta_\mu}{\sigma_\mu^2}\right](\sigma_\mu^2)^{T/2} \prod_{t=1}^T \exp\left[\frac{(\mu_{t} - \mu_{t-1})^2}{2\sigma_\mu^2}\right]\\
&\propto \sigma_\mu^{2(\alpha_\mu + T/2 - 1)}\exp\left\{\frac{1}{\sigma_\mu^2}\left[\beta_\mu + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{t=1}^T(\mu_{t} - \mu_{t-1})^2\right]\right\},
\end{align}
which is an inverse gamma distribution,
\begin{align}
p(\sigma_\mu^2|\ldots)&\sim \mathcal{IG}\left(\alpha_\mu + T/2, \beta_\mu + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{t=1}^T (\mu_{t} - \mu_{t-1})^2  \right).
\end{align}
\item $\lambda_j$. The conditional distributions for the House effects are normally distributed since both the prior and the likelihood are normal. Letting $\mathcal{P}_j$ refer to the set of polls published by firm $j$ during the campaign and using standard results for conjugate normal models, $\lambda_j$ is normal with mean,
\begin{align}
\left[\sum_{k \in \mathcal{P}_j}\frac{y_k - \mu_{t[k]}}{\sigma^2_k}\right] \left[\sum_{k \in \mathcal{P}_j} \frac{1}{\sigma^2_k} + \frac{1}{\sigma^2_\lambda}\right]^{-1}
\end{align}
and variance,
\begin{align}
\left[\sum_{k \in \mathcal{P}_j} \frac{1}{\sigma^2_k} + \frac{1}{\sigma^2_\lambda}\right]^{-1}.
\end{align}
\item $\theta_{1:T}$. The states can be sampled from their conditional distribution,
\begin{align}
\label{eqn: conditional state}
p(\theta_{1:T}|\ldots)&= p(\theta_T| Y_{1:T}, A_t, \Lambda, \sigma^2_\mu) \prod_{t=0}^{T-1} p(\theta_t|\theta_{t+1}, Y_{1:t}, A_t, \Lambda, \sigma^2_\mu).
\end{align}
Equation~\ref{eqn: conditional state} suggests that if we could sample $\theta_T$ then we could recursively backwards sample through the rest of the states, $\theta_{1:T-1}$. The \emph{forward filtering backwards sampling} (FFBS) is the standard method for generating this sample. The filtering portion of the algorithm is the Kalman filter discussed in the text and works by starting from an initial value $\theta_0$ and then sequentially updating each $\theta_t$ as new information becomes available. The backwards sampling part then smooths the values of the states by first sampling from $\theta_T$, and then from the conditional distribution of $\theta_{T-1}$, and so on all the way through all of the remaining states $\theta_{1:T-2}$. To summarize, the FFBS algorithm proceeds in the following manner: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Run Kalman filter.
\item Draw $\theta_T \sim N(m_T, C_T)$ where $m_T = E(\theta_T|Y_{1:T}, A_t, \Lambda, \sigma^2_\mu)$ and $C_T = \var(\theta_T | Y_{1:T}, A_t, \Lambda, \sigma^2_\mu)$.
\item For $T-1, \ldots, 0$ draw $\theta_t \sim N(h_t, H_T)$ where $h_t = E(\theta_t|\theta_{t+1}, Y_{1:t}, A_t, \Lambda, \sigma^2_\mu)$ and $H_t = \var(\theta_t|\theta_{t+1}, Y_{1:t}, A_t, \Lambda, \sigma^2_\mu)$.
\end{enumerate}
In this case, letting $\mathcal{P}_t$ refers to the set of all polls published on day $t$ we have,
\begin{align}
m_t &= \left[\sum_{k \in \mathcal{P}_t} \frac{y_k - \lambda_{j[k]}}{\sigma^2_k} + \frac{M_{t-1}}{C_{t-1} + \sigma^2_\mu}\right]\cdot C_T,\\
C_t &= \left[\sum_{k \in \mathcal{P}_t} \frac{1}{\sigma^2_k} + \frac{1}{C_{t-1} + \sigma^2_\mu} \right]^{-1},
\end{align}
and,
\begin{align}
h_t &= \left[\frac{\theta_{t+1}}{\sigma^2_\mu}+ \frac{m_t}{C_t}\right]H_t, \\
H_t &= \left[\frac{1}{\sigma^2_\mu} + \frac{1}{C_t}\right]^{-1}.
\end{align}
For additional details on the Kalman filter and the smoothing algorithm see a text such as \citet{west1997bayesian}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{District Model}
Inference for the district model proceeds in a similar manner to the national model using the DLM form from equations~\ref{eqn: dlm observation} and \ref{eqn: dlm state}. The posterior density is,
\begin{align}
p(\theta_{1:T}, \sigma^2_{\xi}|Y_{1:t}) &= \prod_{t=1}^T p(Y_t|\theta_t, V_t)\prod_{t=1}^T p(\theta_t|\theta_{t-1}, \sigma^2_\xi) p(\theta_0) p(\sigma^2_\xi).
\end{align}
Again using an inverse gamma distribution for the variance parameter, $\sigma^2_\xi \sim \rm{IG}(\alpha_\xi, \beta_\xi)$, the Gibbs sampler is as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\sigma_\xi^2$. Draw from the conditional distribution,
\begin{align}
p(\sigma_\xi^2|\ldots)&\propto p(\sigma_\xi^2) \prod_{t=1}^T p(\theta_{t}|\theta_{t-1}, \sigma_\xi^2) \\
&\propto (\sigma_\xi^2)^{(\alpha_\xi - 1)}\exp\left[\frac{\beta_\xi}{\sigma_\xi^2}\right](\sigma_\xi^2)^{Tm/2} \prod_{t=1}^T \prod_{i=1}^m \exp\left[\frac{(\xi_{it} - \xi_{i,t-1})^2}{2\sigma_\xi^2}\right]\\
&\propto \sigma_\xi^{2(\alpha_\xi + Tm/2 - 1)}\exp\left\{\frac{1}{\sigma_\xi^2}\left[\beta_\xi + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{t=1}^T \sum_{i=1}^m (\xi_{it} - \xi_{i,t-1})^2\right]\right\},
\end{align}
which is an inverse gamma distribution,
\begin{align}
p(\sigma_\xi^2|\ldots)&\sim \mathcal{IG}\left(\alpha_\xi + Tm/2, \beta_\xi + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{t=1}^T \sum_{i=1}^m (\xi_{it} - \xi_{i,t-1})^2  \right).
\end{align}
\item $\theta_{1:T}$. The states $\xi_{it}$ are drawn using the FFBS algorithm.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Extra stuff}
The analyses in this paper utilize four main sets of data: data on nationwide variables, data on representatives from the U.S. House, campaign contributions data, and polling data. The main nationwide variables collected are the president's net approval rating and the Gallup generic Congressional ballot. Both the presidential approval rating and the Gallup generic ballot were obtained from the Roper Center Public Opinion Archives. The net approval ratings is the percentage of survey respondents who approve of the president minus the percentage who disapprove. The ratings are based on polls conducted by various polling organizations multiple times each month. The generic ballot is based on a survey question that asks voters whether they intend to vote for a generic (does not include candidate names) Republican or Democrat in the House election. Survey results for this question are more difficult to obtain than presidential approval ratings since each poll must be searched for individually so I consequently restrict the generic ballot questions to those asked by Gallup in August (the month the forecast is being made).

The second dataset consists of data from three sources: data on  House elections from 1946 - 2012 obtained from Gary Jacobson; the committee assignments of members of Congress from each district \citep{stewart2015}; and DW-Nominate scores from \url{http://voteview.com/}. The Gary Jacobson data provides information on a number of important characteristics of House elections at the district level. These include the Democrat's share of the two party vote in both House and presidential elections, whether an incumbent is running for reelection (and the party of the incumbent), and whether a challenger has previously held office. The DW-nominate scores are the first dimension scores originally developed by Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal, which can be interpreted as the liberal-conservative divide in modern politics \citep{poole1997congress, poole2011ideology}.

The third dataset contains campaign finance data provided by the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP) at \url{https://www.opensecrets.org/}. CRP obtains the data from the Federal Election Commission and adds value to it by cleaning and categorizing the data. The data covers campaign contributions from individuals (above \$200) and Political Action Committees (PACs).\footnote{Contributions from party committees are included in the PAC table.} The data can be separated by date, individual employer, and PAC type, which allows me to track contributions during different times of the campaign and to focus on spending by different types of contributors. 

The final dataset covers district and national polls for the 2010 House election. The district polls are all of those used by the New York times to forecast the 2010 House election and the national polls are the polls listed for the generic congressional vote on the website \url{http://www.realclearpolitics.com/}. Each poll contains the date that the poll was taken, its sample size and the proportion of respondents favoring the Democrat and Republican candidate.
