# optimal-house
This repository contains the code for my paper [The Optimal Allocation of Campaign Funds
in House Elections](http://devinincerti.com/papers/optimal_house.pdf). The script main.R will run the
the code for the entire paper but, be forwarned, it will take over 15 hours because 3 sepearate 
Bayesian models must be implemented. Scripts 1-load.R and 2-clean.R 
create the Rdata file output/ohdata.Rdata, which is used for the analysis.
